# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

Run commands:
(1) build image
docker builf -f Dockerfile.dev .
(2) start the container
docker run -it -p 3000:3000 IMAGE_ID
docker run -p 3000:3000 IMAGE_ID --build
(3) Map the volumn to reflect the changes in local machine
docker run -p 3000:3000 -v /app/node_modules(don not mao it) -v $(pwd):/app ebe9fb1f7b60
(4) Since the command is so wordy, we can optimitize it with docker compose
Implement docker-compose.yml 
docker-compose up

(5) After using volume, we can get away the 
COPY . . in Dockerfile
But when set up the production, we still need to init the container with those files

(6) start to run the test
npm run test
docker run bce9147b551d npm run test
docker run -it bce9147b551d npm run test

(7) Live updating test
docker exec -it 37c41d1f08a8 npm run test
OR: create a second service on the docker-compose.yaml file
docker-compose up --build

(8) docker attach 2a41b0859f84

(9) npm build: build a production version of the applciation
